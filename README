About Honeyd:
-------------

Honeyd is a small daemon that creates virtual hosts on a network.  The
hosts can be configured to run arbitrary services, and their TCP
personality can be adapted so that they appear to be running certain
versions of operating systems.  Honeyd enables a single host to claim
multiple addresses - I have tested up to 65536 - on a LAN for network
simulation.

It is possible to ping the virtual machines, or to traceroute them.
Any type of service on the virtual machine can be simulated according
to a simple configuration file.  Instead of simulating a service, it
is also possible to proxy it to another machine.

Installation:
-------------

Honeyd depends on several libraries:

 - libevent  - event notification
 - libdnet   - packet creation (libdumbnet on Debian)
 - libpcap   - packet sniffing
 - libreadline - command line editing
 - zlib      - compression

To install dependencies on Debian/Ubuntu:

$ sudo apt-get install cmake libevent-dev libdumbnet-dev libpcap-dev \
    libreadline-dev zlib1g-dev flex bison

To build honeyd using CMake:

$ mkdir build && cd build
$ cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo
$ make
$ sudo make install

Documentation:
--------------

You can find documentation as part of this release.  The manual
page can be accessed with the following commands:

$ man honeyd

or in the source directory

$ nroff -mdoc honeyd.8

More information can be found at http://www.honeyd.org/ and https://github.com/cowrie/honeyd

Running:
--------

Honeyd requires root-privileges for execution.  Normally, you run it
with arguments similar to the following:

$ sudo honeyd -d -f config.sample 10.0.0.0/8

It is strongly recommended that you run Honeyd in a chroot environment
or with reduced privileges.  Honeyd drops privileges after creating
its raw sockets if you specify a user with -u <uid> and -g <gid> flags.

Testing
-------

To empirically verify the quality of OS scan results, a bash script named
ostest is included. There are a few "gotcha"s with this, however. Normally,
honeyd ignores packets coming from the same machine that it's running on
so as to avoid routing loops.

An ugly hack to make this work is to use a separate hardware ethernet
interface such as a cheap usb-ethernet adapter. You then have two eth adapters,
call them eth0 and eth1. Set up a route so that the IP address given to
ostest is routing to eth0. You then set up honeyd to listen on eth1.

Honeyd will see packets coming from eth0 and assume that it is a different
machine than ours, and not drop them.
